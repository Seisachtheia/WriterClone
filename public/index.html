                <h1>Stop Starting From Scratch When You Write</h1>
                <p><strong>Everyone says that getting started is the hardest thing about writing. But what if you could make getting started the easiest part of all?</strong></p>
                
                <p>You can massively improve your writing – and get it done much faster – when you think of writing as the assembly of parts.</p>
                
                <p>How long have you spent sharing at this?</p>
                
                <img src="images/first.png"/>
                
                <p><strong> It’s no wonder. Writing is the one of the only creative processes where you’re expected to conjure everything from scratch each time you sit down to work.</strong></p>
                
                <p>I’ve been a writer for 20 years, and it only struck me recently that maybe this should be challenged. Musicians, chefs, designers, software engineers: people who build things almost never start from scratch. They take components and glue them together, filling in the blanks as they go.</p>

                    <p>Graphic designers often use stock elements, and I think that effective writers should do the same.</p>
