                        <h1>Stop Starting From Scratch When You Write</h1>
                        <p><strong>Everyone says that getting started is the hardest thing about writing. But what if you could make getting started the easiest part of all?</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>You can massively improve your writing – and get it done much faster – when you think of writing as the assembly of parts.</p>
                        
                        <p>How long have you spent sharing at this?</p>
                    
                        <div class="first-wrap">
                            <img src="/images/first.png"/>
                        </div>                                               
                    
                        <p><strong> It’s no wonder. Writing is the one of the only creative processes where you’re expected to conjure everything from scratch each time you sit down to work.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>I’ve been a writer for 20 years, and it only struck me recently that maybe this should be challenged. Musicians, chefs, designers, software engineers: people who build things almost never start from scratch. They take components and glue them together, filling in the blanks as they go.</p>

                        <div class="istock-wrap">
                            <img src="/images/second.png"/>
                            <p>Graphic designers often use stock elements, and I think that effective writers should do the same.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Look at <strong>graphic designers</strong>, for example. If you’ve ever watched a graphic designer work, most of the backgrounds, icons and badges they use come from stock websites</p>

                        <p>An efficient designer will normally buy a funnel diagram template rather than make one from scratch. For $5, why reinvent the wheel?</p>

                        <p><strong>Programming</strong> is another creative process where it’s considered wasteful and ignorant to start from scratch.</p>

                        <p>Coders make heavy use of software libraries, frameworks and components that other people have created. They fashion them together to create something original. If there’s already code that works, a programmer would be insane for attempting to recreate it.</p>

                        <div class="standard-img-wrap">
                            <img src="/images/third.png"/>
                            <p>Many websites use menus and icons from Bootstrap.io. When you’re writing, you should be able to make use of existing elements too.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>There are so many examples of this:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Teachers</strong> use lesson templates to put together lessons.</li>
                            <li><strong>Musicians</strong> assemble their tracks from sample packs and packaged drum loops.</li>
                            <li>Even <strong>nature</strong> uses off the shelf parts: bacteria borrow segments of DNA from other organisms, just like musicians borrow riffs and melodies from other artists.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Almost any creative process that you care to name starts with something to build on, so why should writing be any different?</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>A few years ago, I decided to try to apply this concept to writing.</p>

                        <p>That’s why today – when I sit down to start writing – I don’t see a blank document of despair.</p>

                        <p>Instead, I see this:</p>

                        
                        <img src="/images/fourth.gif"/>
                        
                    
                        <p>This is my ‘swipe file’.</p>

                        <p>It’s a large, constantly growing text document where I paste stories, anecdotes and interesting quips I’ve collected for use in my writing.</p>

                        <p>Whenever I need an interesting way to get people’s attention or begin a piece I’m working on, I just fire up my swipe file and within a few minutes I can normally find something good.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>Suddenly, writing is like going shopping.</strong></p>

                        <p>Here’s an example. I was writing a blog post for a client on ‘digital transformation’ and all the problems that organisations have adapting to disruption. I needed a strong way to open it. So instead of chewing my pen for an hour, I scrolled through my swipe file looking for something suitable.</p>

                        <p>Within a few minutes I’d found this story about Steve Jobs that was just perfect to kick off my piece:</p>
                    
                        
                        <img src="/images/fifth.png"/>
                        

                        <p>Having a scrap book of interesting stories and anecdotes isn’t just useful for figuring out how to begin something – it’s also great for finding ‘pick me up’ material you can sprinkle throughout your writing to give your readers a bit of relief and keep them hooked.</p>

                        <p>A few hundred words in, I felt the piece needed a spritz, so I scrolled through my swipe file and found this:</p>

                        
                        <img src="/images/sixth.png"/>
                        

                        <p>Having a scrap book of interesting stories and anecdotes isn’t just useful for figuring out how to begin something – it’s also great for finding ‘pick me up’ material you can sprinkle throughout your writing to give your readers a bit of relief and keep them hooked.</p>

                        <p>A few hundred words in, I felt the piece needed a spritz, so I scrolled through my swipe file and found this:</p>

                        
                        <img src="/images/seventh.png"/>
                        

                        <p>Just having a little quote there recaptures the reader’s interest and keeps them with me.</p>

                        <p><strong>This swipe file is my biggest asset as a writer. To some extent, it turns writing into a process of assembly.</strong></p>

                        <p>Let me show you some of the things that are in my swipe file:</p>

                        
                        <img src="/images/eighth.png"/>
                        

                        <p>I snagged this passage from a <a class="book" href="https://abookapart.com/products/youre-my-favorite-client">book</a> by a graphic designer.

                        <p>Maybe I could use this to talk about how important it is to take care of the basics.</p>

                        <p>Maybe I could use it to talk about how you never know what your customers will measure you on.</p>

                        <p>Maybe I’ll never use it at all.</p>

                        <p>It doesn’t matter – it’s there when I need it. Here’s another item, this one I found quoted somewhere on Reddit:</p>

                        
                        <img src="/images/ninth.png"/>
                        

                        <p>It’s a nice little story I could probably open with this when I need to communicate:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Why something costs more than people expect</li>
                            <li>How early design decisions suddenly matter close to launch</li>
                            <li>Why it’s important to do things right, because it might be somebody else picking up the pieces</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>One more. Here’s another hook I used recently:</p>

                        
                        <img src="/images/tenth.png"/>
                        

                        <p>I found this in Keith Richards’ <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0047DVHV2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">autobiography.</a></p>

                        <p>It’s quite a flexible anecdote, so I can imagine using this to explain how the era in which a company was founded can shape its path far into the future, or how people’s history is written in the way they behave.</p>

                        <p><strong>Is this making sense? I hope so. </strong></p>

                        <p>Having a scrapbook of story-driven hooks makes writing so simple, it almost feels like cheating. You just go to your swipe file, choose a relevant story and – magic! – you have a great way to begin.</p>

                        <p>I’ve met writers who resist this. They say it’s uncreative, or it’s plagarism. (It’s not, if you take steps to rephrase the story and credit the source where appropriate.)</p>

                        <p>I hope you find this approach useful.</p>

                        <p>The next logical question is – where do you find all these stories? I’ll answer that in my next post.</p>
