                <h1>Stop Starting From Scratch When You Write</h1>
                <p><strong>Everyone says that getting started is the hardest thing about writing. But what if you could make getting started the easiest part of all?</strong></p>
                
                <p>You can massively improve your writing – and get it done much faster – when you think of writing as the assembly of parts.</p>
                
                <p>How long have you spent sharing at this?</p>
                
                <img src="images/first.png"/>
                
                <p><strong> It’s no wonder. Writing is the one of the only creative processes where you’re expected to conjure everything from scratch each time you sit down to work.</strong></p>
                
                <p>I’ve been a writer for 20 years, and it only struck me recently that maybe this should be challenged. Musicians, chefs, designers, software engineers: people who build things almost never start from scratch. They take components and glue them together, filling in the blanks as they go.</p>

                <div class="istock-wrap">
                    <img src="../images/second.png"/>
                    <p>Graphic designers often use stock elements, and I think that effective writers should do the same.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Look at <strong>graphic designers</strong>, for example. If you’ve ever watched a graphic designer work, most of the backgrounds, icons and badges they use come from stock websites</p>

                <p>An efficient designer will normally buy a funnel diagram template rather than make one from scratch. For $5, why reinvent the wheel?</p>

                <p><strong>Programming</strong> is another creative process where it’s considered wasteful and ignorant to start from scratch.</p>

                <p>Coders make heavy use of software libraries, frameworks and components that other people have created. They fashion them together to create something original. If there’s already code that works, a programmer would be insane for attempting to recreate it.</p>

                <div class="bootstrap-wrap">
                    <img src="../images/third.png"/>
                    <p>Many websites use menus and icons from Bootstrap.io. When you’re writing, you should be able to make use of existing elements too.</p>
                </div>

                <p>There are so many examples of this:</p>

                <ul class="body-job-list">
                    <li><strong>Teachers</strong> use lesson templates to put together lessons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Musicians</strong> assemble their tracks from sample packs and packaged drum loops.</li>
                    <li>Even <strong>nature</strong> uses off the shelf parts: bacteria borrow segments of DNA from other organisms, just like musicians borrow riffs and melodies from other artists.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Almost any creative process that you care to name starts with something to build on, so why should writing be any different?</strong></p>
                
                <p>A few years ago, I decided to try to apply this concept to writing.</p>

                <p>That’s why today – when I sit down to start writing – I don’t see a blank document of despair.</p>

                <p>Instead, I see this:</p>
